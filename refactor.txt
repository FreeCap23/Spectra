main function:
    scene.render()

scene class:
    initialize objects
    initialize camera
        -fov
        -resolution
        -position
        -rotation matrix
    initialize pixel buffer using camera resolution info
    pixel_color = trace()
    map pixel_color to 0-255 range
    write pixel_color to pixel buffer
    write pixel buffer to file with stb_image

trace function:
    should be able to call itself for reflection, transmission
    will not modify the ray it's tracing
    will loop through objects to find intersections by itself
    will select the closest object and only apply the color then
    will return values between 0 and 1
